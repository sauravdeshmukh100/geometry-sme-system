blocks of plane geometry and will help us in understanding more advanced topics in geometry such as the construction and analysis of different shapes 2 1 Point Mark a dot on the paper with a sharp tip of a pencil The sharper the tip the thinner will be the dot This tiny dot will give you an idea of a point A point determines a precise location but it has no length breadth or height Some models for a point are given below The tip of a compass The sharpened end of a pencil The pointed end of a needle If you mark three points on a piece of paper you may be required to distinguish these three points For this purpose each of the three points may be denoted by a single capital letter such as PZ T Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 13 13-08-2024 16 14 25 Reprint 2025-26 Page 2 Ganita Prakash Grade 614Z P and T These points are read as Point Z Point P and Point T Of course the dots represent precise locations and must be imagined to be invisibly thin 2 2 Line Segment Fold a piece of paper and unfold it Do you see a crease This gives the idea of a line segment It has two end points A and B Mark any two points A and B on a sheet of paper Try to connect A to B by various routes Fig 2 1 What is the shortest route from A to B This shortest path from Point A to Point B including A and B as shown here is called the line segment from A to B It is denoted by either AB or BA The points A and B are called the end points of the line segment AB 2 3 Line Imagine that the line segment from A to B i e AB is extended beyond A in one direction and beyond B in the other direction without any end see Fig 2 2 This is a model for a line Do you think you can draw a complete picture of a line No Why A line through two points A and B is written as AB It extends forever in both directions Sometimes a line is denoted by a letter like l or m Observe that any two points determine a unique line that passes through both of them A B B A Fig 2 1 ABm Fig 2 2 Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 14

in a direction The following are some models for a ray Beam of light from a lighthouse Ray of light from a torch Sun rays Look at the diagram Fig 2 3 of a ray Two points are marked on it One is the starting point A and the other is a point P on the path of the ray We then denote the ray by AP Figure it Out 1 Can you help Rihan and Sheetal find their answers AP Fig 2 3 Rihan marked a point on a piece of paper How many lines can he draw that pass through the point Sheetal marked two points on a piece of paper How many different lines can she draw that pass through both of the points Chapter

O and passes through the point A It also passes through the point B a Can you also name it as OB Why b Can we write OAas AO Why or why not 2 5 Angle An angle is formed by two rays having a common starting point Here is an angle formed by rays BD and BE where B is the common starting point Fig 2 8 The point B is called the vertex of the angle and the rays BD and BE are called the arms of the angle How can we name this angle We can simply use the vertex and say that it is the Angle B To be clearer we use a point on each of the arms together with the vertex to name the angle In this case we name the angle as Angle DBE or Angle EBD The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ∠ i e ∠DBE or ∠ EBD Note that in specifying the angle the vertex is always written as the middle letter To indicate an angle we use a small curve at the vertex refer to Fig 2 9 Vidya has just opened her book Let us observe her opening the cover of the book in different scenarios Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4 Case 5 Case 6 OBA Fig 2 7 Fig 2 8BD Evertexarm arm Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 17 13-08-2024 16 14 27 Reprint 2025-26 Page 6 Ganita Prakash Grade 618 Do you see angles being made in each of these cases Can you mark their arms and vertex Which angle is greater the angle in Case 1 or the angle in Case 2 Just as we talk about the size of a line based on its length we also talk about the size of an angle based on its amount of rotation So the angle in Case 2 is greater as in this case she needs to rotate the cover more Similarly the angle in Case 3 is even larger than that of Case 2 because there is even more rotation and Cases 4 5 and 6 are successively larger angles with more and more rotation The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn that is needed about the vertex to move the first ray to the second ray Fig 2 9Final position of ray Amount of turn is the size of the angle Vertex Initial position of ray Let s look at some other examples where angles arise in real life by rotation or turn In a compass or divider we turn the arms to form an angle The vertex is the point where the two arms are joined Identify the arms and vertex of the angle A pair of scissors has two blades When we open them or turn them to cut something the blades form an angle Identify the arms and the vertex of the angle Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 18 13-08-2024 16 14 27 Reprint

the arms and vertex of each one Some mouths are open wider than others the more the turning of the jaws the larger the angle Can you arrange the angles in this picture from smallest to largest Is it always easy to compare two angles Here are some angles Label each of the angles How will you compare them Draw a few more angles label them and compare Math Talk Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 21 13-08-2024 16 14 28 Reprint 2025-26 Page 10 Ganita Prakash Grade 622Comparing angles by superimposition Any two angles can be compared by placing them one over the other i e by superimposition While superimposing the vertices of the angles must overlap After superimposition it becomes clear which angle is smaller and which is larger BA C QP R Q B PA C R The picture shows the two angles superimposed It is now clear that ∠PQR is larger than ∠ABC Equal angles Now consider ∠ AOB and ∠ XOY in the figure Which is greater Y OX O B YX A O BA The corners of both of these angles match and the arms overlap with each other i e OA OX and OB OY So the angles are equal in size The reason these angles are considered to be equal in size is because when we visualise each of these angles as being formed out of rotation we can see that there is an equal amount of rotation needed to move OB to OA and OY to OX From the point of view of superimposition when two angles are superimposed and the common vertex and the two rays of both angles lie on top of each other then the sizes of the angles are equal Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 22 13-08-2024 16 14 29 Reprint 2025-26 Page 11 Lines and Angles23 Where else do we use superimposition to compare Figure it Out 1 Fold a rectangular sheet of paper then draw a line along the fold created Name and compare the angles formed between the fold and the sides of the paper Make different angles by folding a rectangular sheet of paper and compare the angles Which is the largest and smallest angle you made 2 In each case determine which angle is greater and why a ∠AOB or ∠ XOY b ∠AOB or ∠ XOB c ∠XOB or ∠ XO C Discuss with your friends on how you decided which one is greater 3 Which angle is greater ∠ XOY or ∠AOB Give reasons X O BA Y Comparing angles without superimposition Two cranes are arguing about who can open their mouth wider i e who is making a bigger angle Let us first draw their angles How do we know which one is bigger

them and then check But can we do it without superimposition Suppose we have a transparent circle which can be moved and placed on figures Can we use this for comparison Let us place the circular paper on the angle made by the first crane The circle is placed in such a way that its centre is on the vertex of the angle Let us mark the points A and B on the edge circle at the points where the arms of the angle pass through the circle OOBB A A Can we use this to find out if this angle is greater than or equal to or smaller than the angle made by the second crane Let us place it on the angle made by the second crane so that the vertex coincides with the centre of the circle and one of the arms passes through OA BY AO X Can you now tell which angle is bigger Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd

Fig 2 10 with each other Teacher s Note A teacher needs to check the understanding of the students around the notion of an angle Sometimes students might think that increasing the length of the arms of the angle increases the angle For this various situations should be posed to the students to check their understanding on the same 2 7 Making Rotating Arms Let us make rotating arms using two paper straws and a paper clip by following these steps 1 Take two paper straws and a paper clip 2 Insert the straws into the arms of the paper clip 3 Your rotating arm is ready Make several rotating arms with different angles between the arms Arrange the angles you have made from smallest to largest by comparing and using superimposition Passing through a slit Collect a number of rotating arms with different angles do not rotate any of the rotating arms during this activity Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 25 13-08-2024 16 14 30 Reprint 2025-26 Page 14 Ganita Prakash Grade 626Take a cardboard and make an angle-shaped slit as shown below by tracing and cutting out the shape of one of the rotating arms Now shuffle and mix up all the rotating arms Can you identify which of the rotating arms will pass through the slit The correct one can be found by placing each of the rotating arms over the slit Let us do this for some of the rotating arms Slit angle is greater than the arms angle The arms will not go through the slit Slit angle is less than the arms angle The arms will not go through the slit Slit angle is equal to the arms angle The arms will go through the slit Only the pair of rotating arms where the angle is equal to that of the slit passes through the slit Note that the possibility of passing through the slit depends only on the angle between the rotating arms and not on their lengths as long as they are shorter than the length of the slit Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 26 13-08-2024 16 14 31 Reprint 2025-26 Page 15 Lines and Angles27 Challenge Reduce this angle Angle reduced The angle is still the same 2 8 Special Types of Angles Let us go back to Vidya s notebook and observe her opening the cover of the book in different scenarios She makes a full turn of the cover when she has to write while holding the book in her hand She makes a half turn of the cover when she has to open it on her table In this case observe the arms of the angle formed They lie in a straight line Such an angle is called a straight angle A O B Let us consider a straight angle ∠ AOB Observe that any ray OC divides it into two angles ∠ AOC and ∠ COB Fig 2 11 Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 27 12-12-2024 10 36 03 Reprint 2025-26 Page 16 Ganita Prakash Grade 628 Is it possible to draw OC such that the two angles are equal to each other in size Let s Explore We can try to solve this problem using a piece of paper Recall that when a fold is made it creates a crease which is straight Take a rectangular piece of paper and on one of its sides mark the straight angle AOB By folding try to get a line crease passing through O that divides ∠ AOB into two equal angles How can it be done Fold the paper such that OB overlaps with OA Observe the crease and the two angles formed Math Talk Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 28 13-08-2024 16 14 33 Reprint 2025-26 Page 17 Lines and Angles29Justify why the two angles are equal Is there a way to superimpose and check Can this superimposition be done by folding Each of these equal angles formed are called right angles So a straight angle contains two right angles Why shouldn t you argue with a 90 angle Because they re always right If a straight angle is formed by half of a full turn how much of a full turn will form a right angle Observe that a right angle resembles the shape of an L An angle is a right angle only if it is exactly half of a straight angle Two lines that meet at right angles are called perpendicular lines Figure it Out 1 How many right angles do the windows of your classroom contain Do you see

slanting crease a How many right angles do you have now Justify why the angles are exact right angles b Describe how you folded the paper so that any other person who doesn t know the process can simply follow your description to get the right angle Classifying Angles Angles are classified in three groups as shown below Right angles are shown in the second group What could be the common feature of the other two groups In the first group all angles are less than a right angle or in other words less than a quarter turn Such angles are called acute angles In the third group all angles are greater than a right angle but less than a straight angle The turning is more than a quarter turn and less than a half turn Such angles are called obtuse angles Figure it Out 1 Identify acute right obtuse and straight angles in the previous figures 2 Make a few acute angles and a few obtuse angles Draw them in different orientations Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 31 13-08-2024 16 14 34 Reprint 2025-26 Page 20 Ganita Prakash Grade 6323 Do you know what the words acute and obtuse mean Acute means sharp and obtuse means blunt Why do you think these words have been chosen 4 Find out the number of acute angles in each of the figures below What will be the next figure and how many acute angles will it have Do you notice any pattern in the numbers 2 9 Measuring Angles We have seen how to compare two angles But can we actually quantify how big an angle is using a number without having to compare it to another angle We saw how various angles can be compared using a circle Perhaps a circle could be used to assign measures for angles Fig 2 12 To assign precise measures to angles mathematicians came up with an idea They divided the angle in the centre of the circle into Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 32 13-08-2024 16 14 34 Reprint 2025-26 Page 21 Lines and Angles33360 equal angles or parts The angle measure of each of these unit parts is 1 degree which is written as 1° This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle the measure of an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it For example see this figure 30 units It contains 30 units of 1° angle and so we say that its angle measure is 30° Measures of different angles What is the measure of a full turn in degrees As we have taken it to contain 360 degrees its measure is 360° What is the measure of a straight angle in degrees A straight angle is half of a full turn As a full-turn is 360° a half turn is 180° What is the measure of a right angle in degrees Two right angles together form a straight angle As a straight angle measures 180° a right angle measures 90° A O180 units 90 unitsB A O BA O BA O B A pinch of historyA full turn has been divided into 360° Why 360 The reason why we use 360° today is not fully known The division of a circle into Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 33 14-08-2024 14 20 43 Reprint 2025-26 Page 22 Ganita Prakash Grade 634360 parts goes back to ancient times The Rigveda one of the very oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years speaks of a wheel with 360 spokes Verse 1 164 48 Many ancient calendars also going back over 3000 years such as calendars of India Persia Babylonia and Egypt were based on having 360 days in a year In addition Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all numbers up to 10 aside from 7 Thus one can break up the circle into 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 or 10 equal parts and still have a whole number of degrees in each part Note that 360 is also evenly divisible by 12 the number of months in a year and by 24 the number of hours in a day These facts all make the number 360 very useful The circle has been divided into 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 and 12 parts below What are the degree measures of the resulting angles Write the degree measures down near the indicated angles Degree measures of different angles How can we measure other angles in degrees It is for this purpose that we have a tool called a protractor that is either a circle divided into 360 equal parts as shown in Fig 2 12 on page 32 or a half circle divided into 180 equal parts Chapter

of 1 degree Only part of the lines dividing the straight angle are visible though Starting from the marking on the rightmost point of the base there is a long mark for every 10° From every such long mark there is a medium sized mark after 5° Figure it out 1 Write the measures of the following angles a ∠ KAL Notice that the vertex of this angle coincides with the centre of the protractor So the number of units of 1 degree angle between KA and AL gives the measure of ∠ KAL By counting we get ∠KAL = 30° Making use of the medium sized and large sized marks is it possible to count the number of units in 5s or 10s b ∠WAL c ∠TAK A TWLK Chapter 2_Lines and Angles indd 35 13-08-2024 16 14 34 Reprint 2025-26 Page 24 Ganita Prakash Grade 636Labelled protractor This is a protractor that you find in

determines a location It is denoted by a capital letter A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two points The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both sides indefinitely it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small letter like m A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction indefinitely It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting point Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM also called ∠MOP here O is called the vertex of the angle and the rays OP and OM are called the arms of the angle The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees One full rotation or turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360° Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor Angles can be straight 180° right 90° acute more than 0° and less than 90° obtuse more than 90° and less than 180° and reflex more than 180° and

measure What are the possibilities for my measure Summary A point determines a location It is denoted by a capital letter A line segment corresponds to the shortest distance between two points The line segment joining points S and T is denoted by ST A line is obtained when a line segment like ST is extended on both sides indefinitely it is denoted by ST or sometimes by a single small letter like m A ray is a portion of a line starting at a point D and going in one direction indefinitely It is denoted by DP where P is another point on the ray An angle can be visualised as two rays starting from a common starting point Two rays OP and OM form the angle ∠POM also called ∠MOP here O is called the vertex of the angle and the rays OP and OM are called the arms of the angle The size of an angle is the amount of rotation or turn needed about the vertex to rotate one ray of the angle onto the other ray of the angle The sizes of angles can be measured in degrees One full rotation or turn is considered as 360 degrees and denoted as 360° Degree measures of angles can be measured using a protractor Angles can be straight 180° right 90° acute more than 0° and less than 90° obtuse

the slab For each angle one arm is a side and one arm is the slope The vertical arm is not visible whereas the other arm is visible Here in this toy edges of the slabs are the arms of the angles Top horizontal ray is not visible other arm s in the form of edges of the slab are visible Teacher should motivate students to get other possible answers Page 52 10 Page 49 Section 2 10 Figure it Out Q 1 In Fig 2 23 list all the angles possible Did you find the m all Now guess the measures of all the angles Then measure the angles with a protractor Record all your numbers in a table See how close your guesses are to the actual measures Ans ∠CAP ∠ACD ∠APL ∠DLP ∠RPL ∠SLP ∠PRS ∠LSR ∠BRS ∠CLP Try more Page 52 Section 2 11 Figure it Out Q 2 Use a protractor to find the measure of each angle Then classify each angle as acute obtuse right or reflex Ans a ∠PTR = 30º Acute angle b ∠PTQ = 60º Acute angle c ∠PTW = 102º Obtuse angle d ∠WTP = 258º Reflex angle Let s Explore Q In this figure ∠TER = 80° What is the measure of ∠BET What is the measure of ∠SET Ans ∠BET = 100º ∠SET = 10º Page 53 Figure it out Q 3 Make any figure with three acute angles one right angle and two obtuse angles Ans ∠A ∠B ∠C are three acute angles ∠D ∠F are obtuse angle ∠E is right angle Page 53 11 Q 4 Draw the letter M such that the angles on the sides are 40° each and the angle in the middle is 60° Ans Q 5 Draw the letter Y such that the three angles formed are 150° 60° and 150° Ans Q 6 The Ashoka Chakra has 24 spokes What is the degree measure of the angle between two spokes next to each other What is the largest acute angle formed between two spokes Ans The angle between two spokes next to each other is 15º Largest acute angle between spokes is 75º Q 7 Puzzle I am an acute angle If you double my measure you get an acute angle If you triple my measure you will get an acute angle again If you quadruple four times my measure you will get an acute angle yet again But if you multiply my measure by 5 you will get an obtuse angle measure What are the possibilities for my measure Ans The acute angle can be 19º 20º 21º 22º"
