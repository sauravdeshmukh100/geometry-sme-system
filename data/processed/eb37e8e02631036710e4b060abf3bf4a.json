CONSTRUCTION OF A LINE PARALLEL TO A GIVEN LINE THROUGH A POINT NOT ON THE LINE Let us begin with an activity Fig 10 1 i Take a sheet of paper Make a fold This fold represents a line l ii Unfold the paper Mark a point A on the paper outside l iii Fold the paper perpendicular to the line such that this perpendicular passes through A Name the perpendicular AN iv Make a fold perpendicular to this

choose a point X 4 cm away from l Through X draw a line m parallel to l 3 Let l be a line and P be a point not on l Through P draw a line m parallel to l Now join P to any point Q on l Choose any other point R on m Through R draw a line parallel to PQ Let this meet l at S What shape do the two sets of parallel lines enclose 10 3 C ONSTRUCTION OF TRIANGLES It is better for you to go through this section after recalling ideas on triangles in particular the chapters on properties of triangles and congruence of triangles You know how triangles are classified based on sides or angles and the following important properties concerning triangles i The exterior angle of a triangle is equal in measure to the sum of interior opposite angles ii The total measure of the three angles of a triangle is 180° iii Sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side iv In any right-angled triangle the square of the length of hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides In the chapter on Congruence of Triangles we saw that a triangle can be drawn if any one of the following sets of measurements are given i Three sides ii Two sides and the angle between them iii Two angles and the side between them iv The hypotenuse and a leg in the case of a right-angled triangle We will now attempt to use these ideas to construct triangles 10 4 CONSTRUCTING A TRIANGLE WHEN THE LENGTHS OF ITS THREE SIDES ARE KNOWN SSS C RITERION In this section we would construct triangles when all its sides are known We draw first a rough sketch to give an idea of where the sides are and then begin by drawing any one of∠3 = ∠1 + ∠2 a+ b c∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180° b2+ a2 = c2 2020-21 NCERT not to be republished Page 5 PRACTICAL GEOMETRY 197

This will help us in deciding how to proceed Fig 10 3 i Step 2 Draw a line segment BC of length 6 cm Fig 10 3 ii Step 3 From B point A is at a distance of 5 cm So with B as centre draw an arc of radius 5 cm Now A will be somewhere on this arc Our job is to find where exactly A is Fig 10 3 iii Step 4 From C point A is at a distance of 7 cm So with C as centre draw an arc of radius 7 cm A will be somewhere on this arc we have to fix it Fig 10 3 iv ii i iii iv Rough Sketch 2020-21 NCERT not to be republished Page 6 MATHEMA TICS 198 198198 198198 Step 5 A has to be on both the arcs drawn So it is the point of intersection of arcs Mark the point of intersection of arcs as A Join AB and AC ∆ABC is now ready Fig 10 3 v Now let us construct another triangle DEF such that DE = 5 cm EF = 6 cm and DF = 7 cm Take a cutout of ∆DEF and place it on ∆ABC What do we observe We observe that ∆DEF exactly coincides with ∆ABC Note that the triangles have been constructed when their three sides are given Thus if three sides of one triangle are equal to the corresponding three sides of another triangle then the two triangles are congruent This is SSS congruency rule which we have learnt in our earlier chapter THINK DISCUSS AND WRITE A student attempted to draw a triangle whose rough figure is given here He drew QR first Then with Q as centre he drew an arc of 3 cm and with R as centre he drew an arc of 2 cm But he could not get P What is the reason What property of triangle do you know in connection with this problem Can such a triangle exist Remember the property of triangles The sum of any two sides of a traingle is always greater than the third side Fig 10 3 i v v DO THIS Q6 cmR3cm2 cmP Fig 10 4 Think Is this right 2020-21 NCERT not to be republished Page 7 PRACTICAL GEOMETRY

What type of triangle is this 4 Construct ∆ABC such that AB = 2 5 cm BC = 6 cm and AC = 6 5 cm Measure ∠B 10 5 CONSTRUCTING A TRIANGLE WHEN THE LENGTHS OF TWO SIDES AND THE MEASURE OF THE ANGLE BETWEEN THEM ARE KNOWN SAS C RITERION Here we have two sides given and the one angle between them We first draw a sketch and then draw one of the given line segments The other steps follow See Example 2 EXAMPLE 2 Construct a triangle PQR given that PQ = 3 cm QR = 5 5 cm and ∠PQR = 60° SOLUTION Step 1 First we draw a rough sketch with given measures This helps us to determine the procedure in construction Fig 10 5 i Step 2 Draw a line segment QR of length 5 5 cm Fig 10 5 ii Step 3 At Q draw QX making 60° with QR The point P must be somewhere on this ray of the angle Fig 10 5 iii Step 4 To fix P the distance QP has been given With Q as centre draw an arc of radius 3 cm It cuts QX at the point P Fig 10 5 iv Rough Sketch i ii iii iv 2020-21 NCERT not to be republished Page 8 MATHEMA TICS

What do we observe We observe that ∆ABC exactly coincides with ∆PQR Thus if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two sides and the included angle of another triangle then the two triangles are congruent This is SAS congruency rule which we have learnt in our earlier chapter Note that the triangles have been constructed when their two sides and the angle included between these two sides are given THINK DISCUSS AND WRITE In the above construction lengths of two sides and measure of one angle were given Now study the following problems In ∆ABC if AB = 3cm AC = 5 cm and m ∠C = 30° Can we draw this triangle We may draw AC = 5 cm and draw ∠C of measure 30° CA is one arm of ∠C Point B should be lying on the other arm of ∠C But observe that point B cannot be located uniquely Therefore the given data is not sufficient for construction of ∆ABC Now try to construct ∆ABC if AB = 3cm AC = 5 cm and m ∠B = 30° What do we observe Again ∆ABC cannot be constructed uniquely Thus we can conclude that a unique triangle can be constructed only if the lengths of its two sides and the measure of the included angle between them is given EXERCISE 10 3 1 Construct ∆DEF such that DE = 5 cm DF = 3 cm and m ∠EDF = 90° 2 Construct an isosceles triangle in which the lengths of each of its equal sides is 6 5 cm and the angle between them is 1 10° 3

MEASURES OF TWO OF ITS ANGLES AND THE LENGTH OF THE SIDE INCLUDED BETWEEN THEM IS GIVEN ASA C RITERION As before draw a rough sketch Now draw the given line segment Make angles on the two ends See the Example 3 EXAMPLE 3Construct ∆XYZ if it is given that XY = 6 cm m∠ZXY = 30° and m ∠XYZ = 100° SOLUTION Step 1 Before actual construction we draw a rough sketch with measures marked on it This is just to get an idea as how to proceed Fig 10 6 i Step 2 Draw XY of length 6 cm Step 3 At X draw a ray XP making an angle of 30° with XY By the given condition Z must be somewhere on the XP Step 4 At Y draw a ray YQ making an angle of 100° with YX By the given condition Z must be on the ray YQ also Step 5 Z has to lie on both the rays XP and YQ So the point of intersection of the two rays is Z ∆XYZ is now completed Rough Sketch i ii iii iv Fig 10 6 i v v 2020-21 NCERT not to be republished Page 10 MATHEMA TICS 202 202202 202202 Now draw another ∆LMN where m ∠NLM = 30° LM = 6 cm and m∠NML = 100° Take a cutout of ∆LMN and place it on the ∆XYZ We observe that ∆LMN exactly coincides with ∆XYZ Thus if two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding two angles and the included side of another triangle then the two tr iangles are congruent This is ASA congruency rule which you have learnt in the earlier chapter Note that the triangles have been constructed when two angles and the included side between these angles are given THINK DISCUSS AND WRITE In the above example length of a side and measures of two angles were given Now study the following problem In ∆ABC if AC = 7 cm m ∠A = 60° and m ∠B = 50° can you draw the triangle Angle-sum property of a triangle may help you EXERCISE 10 4 1 Construct ∆ABC given m ∠A = 60° m ∠B = 30° and AB = 5 8 cm 2

Justify your answer 10 7 CONSTRUCTING A RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLE WHEN THE LENGTH OF ONE LEG AND ITS HYPOTENUSE ARE GIVEN RHS C RITERION Here it is easy to make the rough sketch Now draw a line as per the given side Make a right angle on one of its points Use compasses to mark length of side and hypotenuse of the triangle Complete the triangle Consider the following EXAMPLE 4Construct ∆LMN right-angled at M given that LN = 5 cm and MN = 3 cm SOLUTION Step 1 Draw a rough sketch and mark the measures Remember to mark the right angle Fig 10 7 i Step 2 Draw MN of length 3 cm Fig 10 7 ii DO THIS Rough Sketch i ii 2020-21 NCERT not to be republished Page 11 PRACTICAL GEOMETRY 203 203203 203203 Step 3 At M draw MX ⊥ MN L should be somewhere on this perpendicular Fig 10 7 iii Step 4 With N as centre draw an arc of radius 5 cm L must be on this arc since it is at a distance of 5 cm from N Fig 10 7 iv Step 5 L has to be on the perpendicular line MX as well as on the arc drawn with centre N
